## :bulb: Research Projects:
1. [Analyzing and Forecasting the Impacts of Covid-19 Related Lockdown Measures on Air Quality: A Machine Learning Approach-  ](https://medium.com/@anand.aman5500/analyzing-and-forecasting-the-impacts-of-covid-19-related-lockdown-measures-on-air-quality-a-a422cd0c6291)
Removing the influence of meteorological factors from pollutant concentrations and testing if lockdown has had an impact on air quality. Developing a hybrid deep learning based approach to forecast business-as-usual concentrations and quantifying the lockdown impact by comparison with original concentrations during the period.

2. [A Deep Learning Based Hybrid Approach for Short-Term Forecasting of spread of COVID-19-  ](https://medium.com/@anand.aman5500/a-deep-learning-based-hybrid-approach-for-short-term-forecasting-of-spread-of-covid-19-337b6f0d0c26)
Developing a deep learning based model optimized with a Nature-inspired Metaheuristic algorithm for forecasting new covid-19 cases three days and one week ahead for India, USA and Russia with better accuracy.


## Machine Learning Projects:
ðŸ”¹ [Customer Churn Prediction-  ](https://github.com/AmannAnand/Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression)
Performing extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify the best features for model building, and predicting customer churn for a bank using Logistic Regression.
